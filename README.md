# ClothSimulation

A beginner-friendly physics simulation in C++ using SFML.  
This project is my first step into the simulation field.

## Goals

- [x] Open simulation window
- [x] Simulate particles with gravity and drag
- [x] Visualize real-time physics
- [ ] Adding world box
- [ ] Add colision between particles

## Day 1
✅ Created SFML project with Visual Studio  
✅ Black window runs, ready to simulate
✅ Added a particle, simulation works
✅ Added drag and posibility to change between particles
